## Minor Project -EDA
Complete EDA for Titanic Dataset. Try and draw as many insights about the passengers in the TITANIC.

## Major Project 
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing numerous passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. In this, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy and lastly find out which of the ML methods are most accurate.

## Conclusion
In lieu of the Major Project we followed this procedure-
1) Importing the libraries required.
2) Removing the columns that aren't going to affect our ojective.
3) Treating the null values.
4) Treating the outliers in variables.
5) Creating dummy variables and converting features.
6) Defining X & Y and Splitting the Datasheet.
7) Building and Evaluating the model by various techniques. - Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbour, Desicion Tree, Random Forest, Heirarchial Clustering analysis.

### The last step is comparing the accuracy of these 5 Techniques and find the best suited for the objective we cant to carry out:


i)Logistic Regression = accuracy is 80%

ii)K Nearest Neighbour = accuracy is 79%

iii)Desicion Tree = accuracy is 82%

iv)Random Forest = accuracy is 83%

v)Heirarchial Clustering analysis = accuracy is 55%

#### Therefore the most accurate is Random Forest with a accuracy of 83%Â¶
